    <h3><em>We save not because we want to, but because we have to.</em></h3>
    <br>
    <p>The idea of Saving vs Investment is an age old argument that goes back thousands of years. Well, maybe not that
      far back. <br><br>
      However, knowing when to save and when to invest had proved troublesome for a lot of people. Let me tell you more
      about Saving to put your mind at ease.<br><br>
      With the recent pandemic, it brought to test peoples' financial stability. Having savings that can be easily
      withdrawn and used often proved helpful given that some lost their jobs. <br><br>
      This is not aimed at scaring you into saving but is meant to inform you of the benefits of having a Saving culture
      no matter how small.<br>
      So start saving today and slowly watch as the seeds of your future financial stability start to grow.
