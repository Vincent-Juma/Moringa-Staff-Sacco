    <h3>We save not because we want to, but because we have to - By Harry Bett</h3>
    <p>The idea of Saving vs Investment is an age old argument that goes back thousands of years. Well, maybe not that
      far back. <br>
      However, knowing when to save and when to invest had proved troublesome for a lot of people. Let me tell you more
      about Saving to put your mind at ease.<br>
      With the recent pandemic, it brought to test peoples' financial stability. Having savings that can be easily
      withdrawn and used often proved helpful given that some lost their jobs. <br>
      This is not aimed at scaring you into saving but is meant to inform you of the benefits of having a Saving culture
      no matter how small.<br>
      So start saving today and slowly watch as the seeds of your future financial stability start to grow.
    </p>
    <p>Below are some of the different savings options we have:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Educational Savings</li>
      <p>When it comes to education, you hope that you or your family will have enough to propel them to the next level.
      </p>
      <li>Retirement Savings</li>
      <p>It is never too late nor too early to save for retirement. When you get to leave employment, you should be able
        to sustain the lifestyle you enjoyed when you were employed. <br>
        This will be a problem if you did not save while you were working and trying to find another job will be hard.
      </p>
      <li>Health Savings</li>
      <p>When it comes to your health it is always wise to play it safe. Having a fall back plan, should things go
        south, is always a safe bet.</p>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Now that you know what we have on offer, you know are probably wondering how you can get the loans and at what
      interest loan. The form below will help you out with that.</p>
