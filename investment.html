    <p>When it comes to Investment, there is a lot to consider as when done right it could lead to a drastic increase of
      your fund but when done wrong, you could lose a lot. <br>
      Our aim is to stick on the right side and make valuable and smart investments. Our Investment portfolio ranges
      from Financial Markets (Forex Exchange and Stocks), to Seed Capital Investment (this is where we invest in
      promising Startup's). <br>
      One undestandable consern with Investment is how we balance risk against reward. At Moringa Staff Sacco we tend to
      be risk averse by making well thought through Investment decisions.
    </p>
    <p>Our packages include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Light package</li>
      <p>This is for those that do not wish to keep their money for long. It is mainly for those who have cash on hand
        but do not wish for it to reamin "inactive"</p>
      <li>Bright package</li>
      <p>As much as we tend to be risk averse, there are some clients that wish to undertake high risk investments. We
        make <strong>calculated</strong> high risk investments to ensure maximum profits with minimum losses.</p>
      <li>Calm package</li>
      <p>This is often for those that wish to invest their funds long term with a certain level of assuarance eg.
        Gorvernment Bonds.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>Each of the different packages have different rates. The form below has more on this.</p>
